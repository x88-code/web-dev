 Portfolio Website - README

 Overview
This project is a recreation of a visually appealing portfolio website. It showcases a clean and modern layout using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

 Solution Approach

 1. HTML Structure
- The layout is divided into sections:
  - Hero section
  - About/Bio section
  - Skills section (with progress bars)
  - Services section
  - Statistics section
  - Portfolio/gallery section
  - Brand logos section (certifications/affiliates)
  - Footer
- Bootstrap's grid system is used to achieve a responsive layout.

 2. CSS Styling
- Custom styling was separated into a `styles.css` file for better structure.
- A `.brand-logos` class was added to handle the visual style of the logo section above the footer.
- Responsive tweaks were included to optimize layout on smaller screens.


 How to Use
1. Place the `index.html` and `styles.css` in the same directory.
2. Ensure that Bootstrap is linked via CDN in your HTML.
4. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site.
